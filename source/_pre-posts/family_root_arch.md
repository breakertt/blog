My father is a certified constructor and project manager. He has transitioned from pure construction work to the field of building intelligence, which offers greater financial opportunities and profits.

My grandfather was a pure constructor and construction project manager, although he didn't hold formal certifications back then. He personally built all the furniture, desks, and plumbing in their old house with the help of his team. In fact, he mentored a group of apprentices who took 5 to 10 years to become independent, much like pursuing a Ph.D., but with hands dirty (literally) experience.

However, nowadays, my grandfather's work is no longer considered highly skilled; it's generally seen as low-skill labor. The high-skilled aspects have been transferred to university graduates in civil engineering and architectural design, who now mentor workers without getting their hands dirty.

Civil engineering has also lost its popularity academically than 10 or 20 years ago. China housing marketing is collapsing. There are fewer job opportunities with lower salaries and less decent working environment smelling the dust at construction sites  compared to software engineers who spend their days in front of fancy monitors. (I am not saying SDE or doing a PhD in CS is anything reather easy.)

My father specialized in weak eletrical systems wich more about installing routers, swtiches and cameras, which was a completely new domain at the time in China. At that time Huawe is even also not founded. He made their first fortune on installing programmed telephone switch for local ISP dept.

His work is no longer unique either. Now, many people can easily install routers, switches, cameras, and configure them for operation. Learning these skills has become quite straightforward as many educated individuals in China can now read English and there are more Chinese documentations with the emerging of China vendors like Huawei.

It was not the case 30 years ago when all the manuals were in English, and he was the only one in that small town who understood English and had basic electrical knowledge in that specific sector. He didn't made into the university; otherwise, he might have become a professor like my uncle. He struggled with exams, and back then, university admissions in CHina were extremely competitive and challenging.

My father has retired early and is now focusing on his health and longevity, and my parents have found ways to make money through just doing business by my mother, which can be seen as a bit devious, but that's how the world works.

I am still engaged in "architecting", drawing inspiration from both my father and grandfather's legacy, but within a globally influential and cutting-edge context, moving beyond regional projects. My "architectural" roots have evolved from architecting physical buildings to weak electrical systems then now networked distributed software systems which is what I am doing.

PS: Actually we are observing more SDE bullble growing and finally break at some point in the future while civil engineerers already more demanding for places in western world. Maybe my son will go back and become a civil engineer and everything is a cycle at the end of the day.
